# Development Tools
## What should go here?
Any little custom tools that are used in development, and don't have any real place with the
actual code-base. Add to the readme if/when a new tool is added.

## What's here?
### Data Partitioner
A collection of scripts to take arbitrarily arranged dataset files and storing a partition in a
standard format.

### More to be added... probably
